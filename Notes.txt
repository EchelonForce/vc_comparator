https://tinyurl.com/2kqce7o7 with caps and input filter

Made on bread board, had a few noisy areas but adding caps helped. Also put a rc filter on the signal input in the schematic just in case.

Issues on v1 PCB:
 - Negative of the LM393 should be to GND like on the breadboard... cut the trace to -12V and short C8 to GND with a 0 Ohm.
